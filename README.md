# Weezify Desktop (NON OFFICIAL)
A simple Windows desktop client for Rivers Cuomo's Weezify webapp, made with Python.
Mac/Linux support coming soon!

# Requirements
Windows 10 or later. Other versions haven't been tested.. **yet**.

This is a fan-made project, but Rivers if you see this feel free to use it (and maybe improve it.)

# Bugs
Google sign in - working on it


# Build
You can build it by using the py file, and using a PY to EXE compiler. I recommend auto py to exe.
