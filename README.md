# weezifydesktop
A simple Windows desktop client for Rivers Cuomo's Weezify webapp, made with Python.
Mac/Linux support coming soon!

# Requirements
Windows 10 or later. Other versions haven't been tested.. **yet**.

This is a fan-made project, but Rivers if you see this feel free to use it (and maybe improve it.)
